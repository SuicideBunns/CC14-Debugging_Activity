<p>There are parts that have missing closing tags in the html file like "h2" and "a"  which is why the raw file is messy and it has mix elements</p>
<hr>
<p>I also changed the external file link for the css because it is wrong and the css won't work on the html</p>
<hr>
<p>In the css part, there are missing closing bracket which is why some html elements are not getting the styles. In addition, there are missing semi-colon and wrong colon which is why the css is having the styles needed.</p>
